# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description 
In this assignment, we take a look at the back end for an e-commerce website. We configure an Express.js API to use Sequalize to interact with a MySQL database. This project includes starter code which needed editing in order to run correctly. We begin by creating the Schema and Seed data. Next, we launch a server in order to seed the data in a development database. Our goal is to sync the Sequalize models to the MySQL database so we can make requests.
